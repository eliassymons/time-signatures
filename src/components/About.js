          Have you ever been listening to a song and tapping your foot along to
          the groove? Have you noticed that you tap your foot in regular groups?
          The way beats are grouped together is referred to by musicians as
          meter. This is the overall pulse of the music. It's similar to the way
          poems use the same number of syllables from one phrase to the next.

          Understanding meter allows us to understand and connect to the
          division of beats in a piece of music. In traditional notation, the
          meter is indicated at the beginning of a piece of music. The most
          common grouping of beats, at least in Western music, is 4/4, where
          there are 4 beats (pulses) per grouping. Another common grouping style
          is 3/4 (used by waltzes) which has 3 beats per grouping.
